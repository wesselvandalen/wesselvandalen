## Heisann 👋

My name is Wessel, and I'm a Full Stack Software Developer that lives in the Netherlands.

* You're more than welcome to read everything here, but the best experience is at [wesseldalen.eu](https://wesseldalen.eu).

🌸 I have built large-scale business applications with Java Spring, designing complex architectures. I deploy REST APIs, set up CI/CD pipelines, write test cases with JUnit 5, and integrate applications with both SQL and NoSQL databases.

⚛️ I have designed and built large, complex React applications using both JavaScript and TypeScript, focusing on implementing modern and attractive UI designs. I write test cases using tools like Jest, create reusable component architectures, and ensure that my websites follow accessibility guidelines and remain fully responsive across all devices.

**Hobbies:**
- Gym
- Walking in forests/mountains
- Cooking/baking
